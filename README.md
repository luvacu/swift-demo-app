swift-demo-app
==============

A Swift demo application for iOS 8.1. The only purpose of this application is to practice building a functional app in Swift using various UIKit controls, a MKMapView and CoreData.
The app loads a JSON file from Dropbox, parses it to Model Objects and stores them in a in-memory ManagedObjectContext. It lets the user navigate through a list of supermarkets to see the products she needs to buy in a specific supermarket. Also, there is a map view containing the list of supermarkets.
